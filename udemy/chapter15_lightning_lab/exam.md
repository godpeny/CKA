## 1
Upgrade the current version of kubernetes from 1.18 to 1.19.0 exactly using the kubeadm utility. Make sure that the upgrade is carried out one node at a time starting with the master node. To minimize downtime, the deployment gold-nginx should be rescheduled on an alternate node before upgrading each node.


## 2
Print the names of all deployments in the admin2406 namespace in the following format:
DEPLOYMENT CONTAINER_IMAGE READY_REPLICAS NAMESPACE
<deployment name> <container image used> <ready replica count> <Namespace>
. The data should be sorted by the increasing order of the deployment name.

## 3
A kubeconfig file called admin.kubeconfig has been created in /root/CKA. There is something wrong with the configuration. Troubleshoot and fix it.


## 4
Create a new deployment called nginx-deploy, with image nginx:1.16 and 1 replica. Next upgrade the deployment to version 1.17 using rolling update. Make sure that the version upgrade is recorded in the resource annotation.


## 5
A new deployment called alpha-mysql has been deployed in the alpha namespace. However, the pods are not running. Troubleshoot and fix the issue. The deployment should make use of the persistent volume alpha-pv to be mounted at /var/lib/mysql and should use the environment variable MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=1 to make use of an empty root password.


## 6
Take the backup of ETCD at the location /opt/etcd-backup.db on the master node


## 7
Create a pod called secret-1401 in the admin1401 namespace using the busybox image. The container within the pod should be called secret-admin and should sleep for 4800 seconds.

The container should mount a read-only secret volume called secret-volume at the path /etc/secret-volume. The secret being mounted has already been created for you and is called dotfile-secret
